# GoBlackjack
Blackjack, in go. Done mostly as a proof of concept for myself

## Cool things I learned
I really liked the Fisher-Yates inplace shuffling algorythm.

Basic OO principles in Go:  
Type <Hand> Struct are your basic classes  
func (h *Hand) display()  
then functions can be written to act upon them, these are your class methods
